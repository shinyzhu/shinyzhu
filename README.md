👨🏻‍💻 I'm a **full stack + cycle engineer** and a **DevRel** practitioner.

👐 I'm also an **open-source** fan, **life-long learner** and last but least a **procrastinator**.

🔭 I’m currently ~~working on~~ trying to find a new role in [#DevRel](https://github.com/topics/devrel).

📫 You can find content about developer career, DevRel and much more on my blog: [Shiny Zhu](https://shinyzhu.com).

💬 Wanna [talk to me](https://cal.com/shiny/m)? Ask me about anything on programming or others.

## 👇 Let me show you some code here.

- [shinyzhu.github.io](https://github.com/shinyzhu/shinyzhu.github.io): My recently (hope for keeping) updated blog built with Hugo (without any Node packages).
- [Neo4j Advocacy Content](https://github.com/shinyzhu/neo4j-advocacy-content): Learning content about Neo4j the graph database when I was working as a Developer Advocate at Neo4j.
- [Azure Selected](https://github.com/shinyzhu/azureselected): Developer resources localization project when I was working at Microsoft's DevRel team.
