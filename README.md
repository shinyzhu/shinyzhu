# 👏 Hello world, I'm Shiny.

I'm a **full stack developer** and a **DevRel** practitioner.

I am also an **open-source** fan, **life-long learner** and last but least a **procrastinator**.

## 🙌 Oh, IT's Shiny

You can find content about developer career, DevRel and much more on my blog: [IT's Shiny](https://shinyzhu.com).

Wanna talk to me? 

You can [book here](https://cal.com/shiny/m) and ask me about anything on computer programming.

## 👇 Let me show you some code here.

- [shinyzhu.github.io](https://github.com/shinyzhu/shinyzhu.github.io): My recently (hope for keeping) updated blog built with Hugo (without any Node packages).
- [Neo4j Advocacy Content](https://github.com/shinyzhu/neo4j-advocacy-content): Learning content about Neo4j the graph database when I was working as a Developer Advocate at Neo4j.
- [Azure Selected](https://github.com/shinyzhu/azureselected): Developer resources localization project when I was working at Microsoft's DevRel team.

Please check out my pinned repos as well.
