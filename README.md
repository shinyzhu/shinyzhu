👉 The pronunciation of **Shiny** `['ʃaɪni]` is very similar to my Chinese name. And **Zhu** `[zhū]` is the Chinese pinyin, you can say **Zoo** `[zuː]` instead, I like Zootopia the movie.

👨🏻‍💻 I mark myself a **full stack engineer & ops** and a **DevRel** practitioner.

👐 I'm also an **open-source** fan, **life-long learner** and last but least a **procrastinator**.

🔭 Currently I am [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shinyzhu/) and providing cosulting on **AI/ML/Data** system designing and building.
